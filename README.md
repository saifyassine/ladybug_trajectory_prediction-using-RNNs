# Ladybug Trajectory Prediction using RNNs(GRU) 

This project involves predicting the trajectory of a ladybug's movement using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based neural network model using TensorFlow Kera.

## About the Code

The code provided is a Python script that demonstrates the following:

- Importing necessary libraries including NumPy, Matplotlib, random, math, and TensorFlow Keras.
- Generating simulated ladybug movement data.
- Plotting the trajectory of the ladybug.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets and converting them into sequences using TimeseriesGenerator.
- Building and training a GRU-based neural network model using TensorFlow Keras.
- Saving and loading the trained model.
- Testing the model's predictions on a sample ladybug trajectory.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you need to install the dependencies on the requirement.txt file.
